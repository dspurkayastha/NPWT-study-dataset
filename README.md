# NPWT vs CWT in Post-Operative Abdominal Wounds â€” Clinical Trial Dataset

This repository contains the anonymized dataset used in the study:

**"Comparative Effectiveness of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) versus Conventional Wound Therapy (CWT) for Post-Operative Abdominal Wounds: A Randomized Controlled Trial"**

## Study Summary
This single-center RCT (n = 72) compared NPWT and CWT in patients with open post-operative abdominal wounds, evaluating wound healing over a 10-day period. Primary outcome was percentage area reduction (PAR), with secondary outcomes including pain scores and surgical site complications.

### Key Results
- **PAR at Day 10**: NPWT (mean 24.98%) vs CWT (mean 18.55%), *p < 0.0001*
- **VAS Pain**: Significantly lower in NPWT group
- **Complication Rate**: Lower in NPWT arm across multiple metrics
